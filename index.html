Coach Sara Ellis’ Comments –  During the past four years, I have found Morgan Woods to be a very versatile player who is able to play in the central areas of the field as a 4, 5 , 6 or 8 with ease.  When she is focused she has a great vision of the field,  stays poised under pressure situations, and has a knack for being a strong defensive or offensive player.  Morgan’s assets on the soccer field are her knowledge of the game, spatial understanding, and aggressiveness.  Although she is smaller in stature she is strong on the ball and is persistent with her pressure when facing the opposition. Other teams certainly take notice of her and mark her on all offensive possessions because she has a dangerous shot extending a wide range outside the eighteen-yard box. 
Assistant Coach Sam Gribowicz’s Comments – Morgan is a very likeable and engaging player who primarily plays in the central areas of the field (midfield and defense).  Morgan has shown a great ability to interrupt an attack and skillfully maintain control of the ball at her feet to prevent scoring opportunities. She has also shown great composure in some high-pressure moments to prevent the opposition’s build-up in the attacking third and safely redirect the ball away from dangerous areas.

Coach Kris Dawley’s Comments – Morgan despite her height plays softball like she is the tallest player on the field- she is determined to always keep the ball in front of her at second , shortstop, and outfield.
She is a motivator for her teammates and keeps the game fun, in her own Morgan way leads the team on the field and in the dugout. She is not harsh but knows how to inspire each girl on what they need , and treats everyone individually and leads by her words and actions.
Her ability to stretch a base and at times sacrifice her body to go the extra mile to help the team is impressive to see, and she does it with a smile and giggle.
Morgan has a natural athleticism in all sports and can grasp and handle the game and fundamentals quickly, she started softball at a later age, but made the all stars the first year over girls playing for years- she just has talent.
Morgan is competitive, determined, skilled, quick both mentally and physically and a coaches dream- she listens to improve and takes constructive criticism and actually works to better herself as a player and for the team- she is a team player.</p>
